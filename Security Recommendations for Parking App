Security Recommendations for Parking App

1.What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?
"The app only requests the minimum set of permissions necessary" (from Platform Interaction section of Android App Security Checklist).
Reasons for choice:
1.Our parking app requires several sensitive permissions based on code review:


2. Currently lacks structured permission management
3.Critical for protecting user privacy and data security
4. Directly impacts core app functionality

2.Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)?
End Users:
Protected from unnecessary data exposure
Clear understanding of what permissions are needed and why
Control over their personal data access
Improved app trust and transparency
Developers:
Clearer permission architecture
Reduced security liability
Easier debugging of permission-related issues
Simplified maintenance
Business Stakeholders:
Enhanced app store compliance
Reduced risk of privacy-related incidents
Increased user trust
Better market reputation

3.If the recommendation was found somewhere other than the provided checklist, include a link to it. 
Direct reference from Android App Security Checklist: https://github.com/muellerberndt/android_app_security_checklist 
Section: Platform Interaction Item: "The app only requests the minimum set of permissions necessary"

4.When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)?
Priority Level: High - Must be implemented before production release
Proposed Schedule:
Week 1: Audit and Analysis 
oReview all current permissions
oDocument necessary vs unnecessary permissions
oCreate permission request flowchart
Week 2: Implementation 
oDevelop permission management system
oIntegrate with existing features
oTesting and validation
Rationale for Urgency:
Core security feature affecting user privacy
Required for app store compliance
Impacts main app functionality (navigation, image loading)
Prevention of potential security incidents

5.Why do you think your project needs your recommendation?
Current Code Review:
1.Navigation Features:

2.Asset Management:

3.User Interface:

Required Permissions:
1.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION - For navigation
2.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - For loading parking signs
3.INTERNET - For data communication
4.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - For connectivity checks
6.How do you think your recommendation could be applied?
A.Permission Management System:

B.Integration Example:

7.How feasible would the implementation be?
·  Technical Requirements: 
React Native Permissions library
Android SDK configuration updates
Permission state management system
·  Resource Requirements: 
Development time: 2 weeks
Testing time: 1 week
Documentation: 2-3 days
·  Implementation Challenges: 
Handling permission denials gracefully
Managing permission state across app
Backward compatibility
Testing on different Android versions
·  Maintenance Considerations: 
Regular permission audit needed
Updates for new Android versions
User feedback monitoring
Permission-related error tracking
